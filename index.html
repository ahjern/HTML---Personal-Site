      I am a hardcore Harry Potter fan. I love coffee, reading, yoga, spacing
      out somewhere nice and relaxing.

    <p>
      Grewing up as a kid, my favourite things to do whenever I got home from
      school were reading and blogging. These hobbies had stay with me
      throughout my secondary school years. I used to read a lot, and I loved to
      make different templates for my personal blog. Little did I realize I had
      so much passion for making up a new template, changing a new template for
      my blog almost every week. My hobbies died when I went to study at the
      univeristy, due to I chose a completely different path. Today at an age
      closes to 30, I find it is time to get back to my hobbies.

      and thoughts, and of course to see what I can do with building up my own
      website.
